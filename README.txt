Formations and battle AI can be toggled in Camp->Change TLD options. The default is ON. OFF will revert to Native's blind charge and, for major factions, advancing in line.

However even if you don't have formations on, your troops will position themselves and hold at the beginning of each battle, instead of blindly charging.
Only major factions (all 18 of them) use formations (+deserters), bandits will simply charge. There is a slight difference between good and evil factions, good infantry will form shield walls (usually defensive - shielded troops first, but it can form a phalanx if you have pikemen), while evil infantry will form ranks (best troops first).

Formations only work in field battles (meaning not in custom battles and sieges).

QUICK PLAY GUIDE (Motomataru):
Any time in-game that you have a formation form or "Hold," it will set up near the position that the player had when the command was issued: infantry to the left, cavalry to the right, and archers up front. Additionally, the formations may maintain the same FACING that the player had (depending on mod design).

Whenever a unit first forms a particular formation, troops may spread out for ease of forming up (depending on mod design).

Player troops start every battle in formation.

Unless changed by mod design, formation key bindings are:
"J" for ranks
"K" for weapon-based ranks (shieldwall, phalanx)
"L" for wedge (the player ought to reassign the "L" for "Log" mapping)
";" for square
"U" for no formation (undo formation)

The "ranks" command for archers puts them in a staggered line.

Cavalry will not make any formation other than the wedge.

Charge (and Dismount for cavalry) will undo a formation. The player may Advance multiple times to have a formation move toward the average position of the enemy. Or use the order panel or hold-F1 to place them (or sweep them across the enemy for the cavalry wedge).

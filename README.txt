3.11-3.13 Unknown changes :)


TLD 3.1 changes

Major updates:
- Massive music update
- Strategy:
  -- More aggresive AI in campaigns and sieges; riskier attacks against very weak factions
  -- Highly-ranked players can suggest siege targets to marshalls
  -- Last-stand guardian parties spawn when a faction is almost crushed (allowing to defeat it by defeating the guardian party)

Minor updates:
- New battle scenes and landmarks
- Hit-boxes revamp
- Evil companion dialogs (Bolzog by Amman, the rest by Taal - thanks guys!)
- Companions cost influence
- Rhun and Gundabad parties made tougher, less camps are immediately siegable
- Factions stop regenerating strength when brought down under 500
- Marshalls will engage in defensive patrols against enemy patrols, not just lords
- New sounds: quest events, lord deaths, rank promotion
- Captured dwarves in chains
- Gondor Lords hire more of their native (fiefdom-specific) troops
- Meshes optimizations (redundant vertices), especially LODs

Fixes:
- Party members exchange problems fixed?
- Lost companions can be always rehired
- Corrupt save problem delayed by spawning less parties less frequently
- Several sticky map places fixed (including Aldburg) 
- Parties getting stuck in rivers get unstuck every few days (doesn't solve all map problems)
- Empty parties get removed every few days
- Empty volunteer parties removed from destroyed towns
- Plenty of other stuff

3.01 Changelog (most important issues):
- Elves nerfed somewhat, -40 weapon proficiencies across the board, fewer volunteers, a bit slower training
- Gunda and Rhun buffed somewhat, to not suck on dwarves and Dale too fast
- Marshalls made more persistent in campains. How it plays out actually is for you to test
- Dwarves got LODs, will be less demanding to video
- Fixed MANY bugs, see forum 1st post in bugreport thread

TLD team

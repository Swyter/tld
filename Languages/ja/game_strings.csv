You settle in your holdfast at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your liege lord.

str_npc1_backstory_a|わが友人、君は大変なときに来てしまった。 イシリアンは敵の偵察隊やら遊撃隊やらでいっぱいだ。 オークの大群が行軍していくのを見た者もいる。 我々はあの不浄の生き物どもが 大河を渡るのを阻止しようと試みているとこで、 私も野伏の一隊を率いて多くの戦果を挙げた。 我々のファラミア隊長は勇敢だし、 我々があの闇に屈する事はない。
str_npc2_backstory_a|おお、私についてお尋ねくださるとは、 なんという美しい心配り。 私は執政閣下の大広間につい最近配属されたばかりの衛兵でして、 名誉ある任務ではりますが、 多少、暇をもてあましております。
; str_npc3_backstory_a|Well, my old helmet here is getting smaller by the minute and the ground seems wobbly as if I rode a mischievous foil. Ah, if I only hadn't drank all that ale last night - I normally have a good head for drink, so it must have been some nasty orc brew.
; str_npc4_backstory_a|My name is Gálmynë, and I made it my business to know yours, {playername}. Let me explain why.
; str_npc5_backstory_a|You may have heard tales of my deeds in battles past and forgotten by mortal Men. In the fullness of time this War is yet another time of danger for the Eldar, but it will be the Last War.
str_npc6_backstory_a|感じの悪いのは謝るわ、旅の人。 でも、ここを訪れる数少ない来客といえば、 信用できない者ばかりなの。 つい一週間まえにここへ来た、 あのドワーフときたら・・・ 何でもないわ。 私はルエヴァンナ、 闇の森のシルヴァン・エルフよ。
; str_npc7_backstory_a|Polite of you to ask, {playername}. We are fighting off incursions from Easterlings and Gundabad orcs, but so far nothing we and our Dale allies can't handle.
; str_npc8_backstory_a|I'm sure you can find some fine volunteers if you speak to the quartermaster in the barracks. As for me, I'm merely a healer and herbalist of modest skills.
str_npc9_backstory_a|あんた、いいね！ わしは、グルム。 上官をやっちまって、 やつのスナガどもに追われとるんじゃ。^あの役立たずの豚め、 自業自得じゃ！ 以前、 ワラ頭の偵察隊に奇襲されたんじゃがな・・・ やつは一人で勝手に負けよったんじゃ。 「退却」とか叫んでな、 やつはさっさと逃げちまったのさ。 その場にとどまって 突撃してくる馬をさばいたのは グルムと他数匹だけじゃ。 黄色い頭がすり身になるまで 殴ってやったわ(ヒッヒッヒッ)。 わしらがおらんかったら、 部隊は全部ミミズのエサになっとったところじゃ。

; str_npc12_backstory_a|I'm in command of a band of lads up here. I'm Gorbag and you'd best learn quick lubber us Uruks are the real bosses 'round here. The Big Bosses makes slips, 'ay, even the Biggest can make mistakes, and always the poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. They don't even tell us all they know, do they? Not by half. Grr!
; str_npc13_backstory_a|I? I am a grain of soil from southern sands, blown north by cold and dark night winds. I am Lykyada, a Serpent Lord of Haradwaith. Lord of the Gold Serpent, bane of the Black Serpent Tribe, now allied to serve the will of the Dark Lord.
; str_npc14_backstory_a|I am Fuldimir, son of the southern realm of Umbar, south of Harondor, and the Bay of Belfalas, for both are home to my heart and my people. We are the lords of sea and sail, corsairs to some, kin of the Bay of Belfalas for her waters we tame.
; str_npc15_backstory_a|I am Bolzog the Gifted, Setter of Bones, Closer of Cuts, and Shaman of Healing. If you go to war for The Eye, you will no doubt have one or other of your little fellows cut about a bit by pale-faced foresters or the horse-lovers. Now, -nar-nar-nar! - Orcs are easy to replace, Oh Great Leader, but can you replace a Warg? A Giant? A Cave Troll? Shi-shi! No! You need me, the Great Bolzog!
; str_npc16_backstory_a|Well now, it is the stranger who should declare himself first. Nevertheless, I am Varfang of the Balcoth kin... I can tell that you have not yet heard the songs or tales of my land that speak the name of the Balcoth, for the very name would check your courage and fill your heart with woe.
; str_npc17_backstory_a|They call me Dímborn and I work in the woods. It is nice there. I like the woods. Many trees in the woods. I like trees. I've worked in the woods all my life, because I am strong and because I like trees.
; str_npc1_backstory_b|You should know that I am an Ithilien Ranger of Dúnedain descent and valor. I know much of tracking and scouting and my skill with bow and sword is known to the orc. I can also train any soul that's willing to fight the coming Shadow.
str_npc2_backstory_b|私はこの白い都の治安を守り、 執政閣下にお仕えするため、 ミナス・ティリスの衛兵となるべく訓練を受けました。
; str_npc3_backstory_b|I am a Rider of the West Emnet éored - they left without me on a long patrol to the Isen fords. I know their conduct will be worthy of the green banner, but I fear many won't return.
; str_npc4_backstory_b|I was born into a noble family and I have been serving Lady Éowyn as a maid of honour ever since we were little girls. Our fathers were wise enough to allow us to train alongside our brothers in matters of combat, to become shieldmaidens of Rohan.
; str_npc5_backstory_b|Lord Elrond sent me as an emissary to Lord Celeborn, to give aid and advice as it's needed in the War in this part of Rhovanion.
str_npc6_backstory_b|わたしは、この美しい森の、 秘密の小道を歩くのがすき。 ときどき息をひそめては、 木々の影から森に住む動物たちの営みを、 そっと観察するの。 めずらしい鳥の歌や、 巣ごもりをする野生の熊たちの姿は、 わたしにとってはエダインが武器をぶつけあったり、 大きな城壁に心を奪われたりするのと同じくらい、 興味を引かれることなの。
; str_npc7_backstory_b|I helped improve the Erebor defenses and trained some younger dwarven folk, under the direction of my venerated father Dwalin, as is our custom.
; str_npc8_backstory_b|I have treated my King Brand for constipation, a common malaise affecting men going to war. A light brew of wormwood, and both the bowels and the mind are put at ease.
; str_npc9_backstory_b|So I said to myself, 'Gulm, you want end up as carrion?' and I answered, 'No'.^Next battle, I fell back pretending I was injured. Then, with no one watching, I fell upon my sergeant! Cleaved him almost in half, gharr! Then cut his sidekick snaga nicely^^...Turned out that bloody creeper survived somehow, and started waggling his tongue about all this. Next time I make sure his head is off, gharr...
str_npc10_backstory_b|俺はアイゼンガルドの狼乗りで、 追跡兵だ。
; str_npc11_backstory_b|Ar! It's only 'cause my nose was snotty. An' what good is it wearing my nose out on stones anyhow? Nar! It was those filthy Uruks! Those cursed peaching sneakthiefs! I only lost the scent through giving way to them. They messed up the scent back there, pinching anything they found, and stomping all round the place before I could get there.
; str_npc12_backstory_b|And those Nazgul give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving in the city. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em.
; str_npc13_backstory_b|I saw of late the word of the Dark Lord spread among my kin, and in their hearts and minds his will crept. Most were drawn to his darkness, and in place of their courage grew an insatiable lust for slaughter so that when their ears heard his call few puppets were so willing to answer.
; str_npc14_backstory_b|There is much change in a man who rides the tumult of the winds and seas of the Belfalas waters, and those yet to battle her will are but children. For stout men are they who meet her tempest and ride her storm. I have laid eyes on her darkest tide and yet remain her master.
; str_npc15_backstory_b|Many moons ago, when I was just a fresh little thing, my Grandsire led the tribe down into the mines, where the dwarves had recently died. A Fire Wraith had passed through, and it was comfortable and warm. We prospered, but every so often some cruel adventurer, or Dwarf hero, would come and kill and maim us in our peaceful tunnels. My hands learned to close the wound of sword or axe, and my mind learned to see the outline of bone and sinew below any hide. These days, I can work a potion or set a break with equal skill.
; str_npc16_backstory_b|The Balcoth were a fierce race of men from my home land, slaughtered by these westerlings to all but a few men. Chased down like beasts of burden as food for their blades. The blood spilt by those blades is the same blood that flows within me, for within me their house continues.
; str_npc17_backstory_b|You can make many things out of the trees, you know. It's what I do. I work with trees and make things out of trees. Sometimes bushes also. But I like trees more.
; str_npc1_backstory_c|However, I fear we are hopelessly outnumbered here in Ithilien and we won't last long without reinforcements or bolder action by our Steward. I might as well help where my actions would account for more, if my Captain Faramir gives me leave.
str_npc2_backstory_c|しかしながら、 我が任務の重要性は理解するものの、 私は常日頃、 実際の戦闘を見てみたいと切望しておりまして、 それと・・・ エルフやしゃべる木やオリファントなどというものも見てみたい、 と考えるわけであります！ 指揮官殿、 あなたは旅のご経験が豊富のようだ、 これは断じて、 あなたの格好を見てそう言っているのではありませんよ。 私は物覚えが非常に早く、 さらに料理の上手でして・・・ まあ、部隊で出される食事としては、ですが。 あなたは志願兵を募っていらっしゃると見受けますが、 いかがですか？
; str_npc3_backstory_c|So, here I am, disgraced and bitter. My éored must be miles away now, and I wouldn't have a fair chance of catching up with them, not with all the orcs and wildmen roaming the plains. Are you by any chance in need of a fine Rohirrim rider?
; str_npc4_backstory_c|You might know that women, however skilled, are not allowed to ride with the éoredas. However, I do not think that waiting by the hearth for the warriors to return is my fate. I will not sit idle until all chance of great deeds is gone in this War, and I would welcome your assistance, warrior.
; str_npc5_backstory_c|However, if the enemies of Lothlórien are on the run, I might consider joining you for a while, {playername}. I sense our fates in this War are interwoven.
str_npc6_backstory_c|みたところ、 あなたは戦いに熱心みたいだし、 こんな事は、 あなたには理解できないかもしれないわね。 でも、 あなたは遠く離れた、 いろいろな場所を旅をして来たのよね ― ここ以外の大森林に行った事はある？ わたしをそこへ連れて行けないかしら？
; str_npc7_backstory_c|There is a lull in the fighting that ill-suits a dwarven warrior of my ancestry and temperament. I gather you get to see much more action in your travels and your cause is friendly with the dwarves? I know a fighting dwarf will greatly improve your chances of survival.
; str_npc8_backstory_c|I hear there is much fighting elsewhere and our lands are gratefully spared for now. From the scratches on your armor you must have been in danger many times. Maybe my humble skills could be better used with your company, for the greater good of all.
; str_npc9_backstory_c|I am a fighting Uruk-hai, and a berserker! What there is to know of killing men, I know it. I was in the service of the White Hand, but now the Hand would as likely throw me into the fire-pits.^^I would come with you and hunt men in the south, while the snagas of Isengard gnash their teeth.
str_npc10_backstory_c|おまえになら仕えてやってもいい。
; str_npc11_backstory_c|All right, all right! My nose isn't much use. I reckon my eyes are better than my nose. Ai! But my nose is only no good cause it don't know what nothing smells like. It don't even know what it's looking for, I tell you. Ar! I just need to go lopin' off and start sniffing places.
; str_npc12_backstory_c|Eh, if I get a chance, I'll slip off and set up somewhere on my own with a few trusty lads, somewhere there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses. I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em, like old times.
; str_npc13_backstory_c|I followed my kin north, and heeded his dark call, to fulfill the duty I have to my people. But in them I see his darkness dwell and I seek to do my part in this war elsewhere, until the sands of my time no longer fall. Even now I feel them begin to trickle where before there was a cascade.
; str_npc14_backstory_c|But there comes yet the darkest tide, a black tide of shadow, which will rise over these lands such as which no mortal eyes will have seen. This is the tide I seek to master, but I am without a crew hardy enough to ride this storm.
; str_npc15_backstory_c|After many winters I came up out of the tunnels, and looked about in the Dark Forests for a good place to live and practice my arts. I was doing fine, until some big ugly bastards with white tattoos – eugh! White! Like an elf face! – big bastards, they were. They fired my little place in the Forest, and I had to hide in the caves again... In here... Say, have you anything to eat? Maybe a nice horse?
; str_npc16_backstory_c|That was many lives of men ago, a different time, but the time for grief and tales are over. The time for my people's retribution has come and I will carve my people's vengeance on the face of these western lands. By my hand, their homes will waste and wither until their clan is no more!
; str_npc17_backstory_c|If you're going into the forest, maybe I come along and tell you about the trees there? Many very interesting trees there, you know.
; str_npc1_backstory_later|I have been leading scouting parties to the south, as far as Emyn Arnen. There is much Enemy activity and many an orc fell to our ambush. Alas, that's only so many orc heads rolling down the gullies, we saw a myriad of foul creatures on the march. I fear for my Ithilien and the fate of Gondor.
str_npc2_backstory_later|このところは、 ここを訪れる人の数も少なくなっております。 あまり良い兆しとは言えません。
; str_npc3_backstory_later|Still no news of my éored, and I'm keen on riding down some orcs.
; str_npc4_backstory_later|More riders return with their bodies broken, and I try to give aid where I can. But I still feel trapped in a cage.
; str_npc5_backstory_later|Have you reconsidered? The time for the Eldar grows short.
str_npc6_backstory_later|わたしはこの二日間、 大蜘蛛の巣を観察していたの。 初めて見るとその姿の醜さに驚くかも知れないけれど、 彼らは侵入者から森を守っているのよ。 今日はわたしを旅へ誘いに来たの？
; str_npc7_backstory_later|Building up defensive walls is worthy of any dwarf. But I need to use my axe too. Soon. Let me come with you.
; str_npc8_backstory_later|I made another call to our King, this time for vomiting. I hope his resolve to engage the enemy is not related to his conditions. Do you suffer from constipation and vomiting too?
; str_npc9_backstory_later|What do you think I do? Gulm is sitting here and waiting for some sneaky snaga to stick him in the dark. Take me with you - I will serve well.
str_npc10_backstory_later|考え直したか？ 俺は使えるオークだぞ。
; str_npc11_backstory_later|Ar! It was you! I smelt you, I knew you were coming. Tell the Bosses that, will ya? They think since I was kicked out of the trackers that it's safe to flout me, well they're mistaken, I'll put an arrow in their guts first. And whose blames was that? Not mine!
; str_npc12_backstory_later|I have my orders. Any trespasser found by my lads up here are to be stripped; teeth, nails, hair and all. But I've got my watchers. We know there are funny things going on: with the big bosses going off to war, and all that. Big things going on away west, they say. Sitting here doin' nothing is more than my belly's worth.
; str_npc13_backstory_later|My role here goes well for the dark cause, and once more the Northerners fear the south. I see great victories ahead, and rivers of blood left in our wake. But with each victory I see my kin corrupted, their hearts twisted to his evil will. The sight of it leads me to despair.
; str_npc14_backstory_later|You have returned stranger, it is perhaps an omen. I have been reading the waters, and I have seen them darken. The sea changes the eyes of a man, and teaches him to use his eyes to listen to her language.
; str_npc15_backstory_later|Many have been the great ones who have begged to be healed by my potions.   Horselovers and the pale-faced elves are many though, and I have had to abandon my hut once more, and am... well, Great Lord, I am not so lucky as when we fought together, and you were grateful for my skills...
; str_npc16_backstory_later|Long does the history of my people recount these lands. I know not what their treacherous histories say of days when my people before entered this land, but sad and dark will their histories be as my people enter it now. Like a storm of hooves and swords and arrows, we will bring them doom like the Balcoth before us.
; str_npc17_backstory_later|I've seen a very old pine the other day. Pines can get very old. You have to respect old trees. But I've also seen some that don't respect trees at all. You respect trees, don't you?
; str_npc1_backstory_response_1|If you can get leave, I have much need of an experienced warrior and a tracker.

I can no longer stand to wait for the plans of far away lords and captains so unseen their existence is believed more in legend than in flesh. Lords whose whispered orders are brought forth and shouted by lesser men. I wait, and with me, my people's vengeance waits also.
; str_npc17_signup|Very good! I know many trees. Soon you will know many trees too. Like me. Because I know many trees.

; str_npc3_signup_2|I've been waiting for someone to take me on, so I only need to saddle up my horse and we are ready to ride.
; str_npc4_signup_2|I have hunted game many times with bows and throwing spears. I will hunt orc under your command. And I have some skill in healing I'm certain will be needed.
; str_npc5_signup_2|Perhaps by joining your company and striking hard where I am not expected, the Enemy will be unbalanced. I will come.
; str_npc6_signup_2|Perhaps I can teach you to move faster and make less noise. Let's go.
; str_npc7_signup_2|If you can keep the tall-folk in your company in line, especially the sneaky Elves, I'll gladly join you.
; str_npc8_signup_2|I must warn you though, I am fairly useless in battle. But I'm sure you are able to keep a woman of my age safe.
; str_npc9_signup_2|But you must decide quickly, the guards here are getting suspicious.
str_npc10_signup_2|俺を部下にして後悔はさせない。
; str_npc11_signup_2|Lots of stuff out there for my nose to smell too, and my knife to taste. They don't know too much now but they're quick learners alright. What d'you say?
; str_npc12_signup_2|I'll show your slugs where there's a whip there's a will and give 'em as much lash as their skins will carry. If your lads take it well it should put 'em in a good trot. What d'you say?
; str_npc13_signup_2|Know, though, that my loyalty lie always with my kin. I have fought this far and lost too much for them. I will not turn my back on them for their fate will be my own.
; str_npc14_signup_2|It is just fortunate that those no longer of this world find no need of this world's treasures and I am fortunate to be skilled in ways that I may assist in relieving the worldly needs of the owners of those treasures.
; str_npc15_signup_2|Oh, this is a great moment for Bolzog The Gifted, and for you, Great Lord! We shall conquer together, you, indestructible with my healing touch, and I, the Great Orc Sage who shall support you!
; str_npc16_signup_2|I fear that I will not wait any longer. I intend on joining the next party to leave camp, with my Chieftain's approval or not. I fear the war will be over long ere I leave to join it.
; str_npc17_signup_2|I'll just get some of my tools, and we can be off. There is this oak just down the road I must show you!

str_npc1_morality_speech|隊長、なぜ{s21}などという、 部下を見捨てるような事をするのか、 私には理解できない。 ファラミア隊長は部下への思いやりを忘れる事などなかったし、 必要のない苦しみを強要することもなかった。
str_npc2_morality_speech|このような事を申し上げて、 お気を悪くなさらないといいのですが、 私にとって、 {s21}という行為は少々理解しがたいのです。 もしかすると私は兵士としての考え方が甘いのかも知れませんが、 あなたがもうすこし・・・ 思いやりを持って兵士たちに接するよう心がけていただければ、 と思います。
str_npc3_morality_speech|隊長、我々エオルの家の子らは、 決して{s21}などという事はしない。 我々の馬は簡単にはへばらないし、 隊を整え直して狙い済ました突撃を繰り出せれば、 いつでも戦いの流れをひっくり返すことはできる。 再び劣勢の戦いに望む事があれば、 ぜひその事を心にとどめ置いていただきたい。
; str_npc4_morality_speech|Take no heed to what the soldiers say, sometimes to {s21} is the wisest course of action. I for one appreciate the lives spared and limbs unbroken, if for nothing else but to fight another day, when fate looks upon us with favor.

; str_npc7_morality_speech|I was not pleased that you decided to {s21}. To fall in battle is an honour for any right-thinking dwarf, but to fight in a company led by a coward is a disgrace. What will my cousins say if they learn of this?

; str_npc16_rehire_speech|Can I serve you once again?
; str_npc17_rehire_speech|Hey. Time to move on again? Trees don't move much. But I like to move. But I like trees too.
; str_npc1_home_intro|Captain, we are approaching Osgiliath now, so let us be on the lookout for friend and foe alike.
str_npc2_home_intro|隊長、用心しましょう。 あそこに見えるのはミナス・モルグルに違いありません。 何かに監視されている感じがしませんか？
; str_npc3_home_intro|A word of advice, commander. We are getting mighty close to Entwood now and the horses are getting restless. Some call the forest Fangorn, too.
; str_npc4_home_intro|Let's stop here for a minute, commander. Ahead of us, between the Anduin and the Limlight, lies the Field of Celebrant, where Eorl the Young rode to the aid of our Gondor allies.
; str_npc5_home_intro|Daro! That's Isengard and the black tower of Orthanc ahead. Much have changed since I last saw them, and none for the better.
; str_npc6_home_intro|Excuse me, {playername}. The paths in this part become more twisted and some lead to dead-ends. We must be approaching Dol Guldur.
; str_npc7_home_intro|Oy, captain! This must be the old path to the Eastern Gates of Khazad-dûm, or Moria as you may prefer. You can see in the distance the glittering lake of Kheled-zâram, and, through the clouds, the three peaks known to grace this part of the Misty Mountains.
; str_npc8_home_intro|Oh, a curious sight! I heard stories about this place where sturdy woodmen are said to live in harmony with animals and plants. Beornings they are called, I gather.
; str_npc9_home_intro|Curses! That must be Hornburg over there, master.
; str_npc10_home_intro|Hey, look!
; str_npc11_home_intro|Hey, look!
; str_npc12_home_intro|Hey, look!
; str_npc13_home_intro|Hey, look!
; str_npc14_home_intro|Hey, look!
; str_npc15_home_intro|Hey, look!
; str_npc16_home_intro|Hey, look!
; str_npc17_home_intro|Ooooo, mallorns grow here! One should never cut down a mallorn, they're just too beautiful!
; str_npc1_home_description|It was a fair city once, the capital of Gondor of old, full of people and laughter. Now it lies deserted and ruined, the old Anduin flowing wearily through a ghost town.
str_npc2_home_description|もうずいぶんと昔の話ですが、 あれはかつてミナス・イシルと呼ばれていました。 言い伝えによると、 月の光に照らされた中庭が銀色の光で満たされ、 周囲の壁を銀色と白色に浮かび上がらせたそうです。 ゴンドールの衛兵はその城壁から東を望み、 エフェル・ドゥアスのかなたを監視したのです。
; str_npc3_home_description|It's thick with trunks and branches and all manner of trees, and I wouldn't venture there as strange creatures roam the forest, not all of them harmless.
; str_npc4_home_description|'Where now the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing?^Where is the helm and the hauberk and the bright hair flowing?...^They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;^The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow...'
; str_npc5_home_description|Once built by the Southern Kingdom, now home to one that we called the White Wizard, scheming, no doubt, how to increase his power further at the expense of others.
; str_npc6_home_description|I have never ventured this far, but I overheard our Greenwood scouts say there may be Nazguls here. I feel an evil presence, but I cannot put a name to it. It is powerful, though, so let us be prepared.
; str_npc7_home_description|Judging by the desolation, and the many orc-tracks, I fear for the fate of the courageous Balin and his expedition. It seems that Moria has fallen to the Shadow and we should tread carefully.
; str_npc8_home_description|Not too often, a travelling merchant comes to the Dale market and offers the finest honey I have ever tasted. For some curious reason, he says that 'it was made by bears' and laughs.
; str_npc9_home_description|Its damned walls are too high and too hard for my hammer to break. I reckon if we ever chase away the manlings from their Edoras pig-sties, they'll run off here and cower behind the walls.

; str_npc1_home_description_2|If Gondor is doomed, West Osgiliath shall fall first to the foul hordes of the Eye. I only hope Captain Faramir would be in command that day and stem the tide. If we could spare any men to bolster the defences here, I would be most grateful, Captain.

; str_npc3_home_description_2|If we must cross Entwood, let us do so with haste and stealth. I don't know who might be listening to our hooves and I don't care to find out.
; str_npc4_home_description_2|We would do well to remember the great deeds of the past and the sacrifices that were made. The Alliance between Rohan and Gondor shall save our peoples from doom once again.
; str_npc5_home_description_2|Let it be a reminder that even the greatest, even one of the Istari, can be corrupted and fall. Those who lust for power can be defeated by power, so let us not tarry much longer.
; str_npc6_home_description_2|I sense the evil armies behind its walls prepare to march... To fair Lothlórien? To Dale? To my Greenwood homeland? I cannot tell, but please do everything you can to thwart them.
; str_npc7_home_description_2|If the fates of war ever provide us with a large army, we should risk the entrance to the Mines and retrieve their mighty riches.
; str_npc8_home_description_2|I can smell the fragrance of many sweet flowers and see the bees harvesting their nectar. If you don't mind, I will gather some herbs for our own use, it will only take a moment.
; str_npc9_home_description_2|There's no use trudging around here if we are not backed by a large Uruk-hai horde. Unless you want to make faces at the lookouts on the wall, that is.

str_rohan_rumor_3|ローハン産に勝る馬なんて、この世にいないよ。 エルフですら、 馬は我々から調達するんだ！

str_rohan_rumor_5|荷馬を8頭用意してくれ、 と言われたんだ・・・ 彼には昨日、 7頭を引き渡したばっかりなんだよ。 一体どうなってるんだろうね。
str_rohan_rumor_6|ゴンドールは頑丈な馬を好む。 我らの馬乗りたちは、 速い馬が好きだ。 エルフは最高の馬しか買わない。 で、敵はそれらの馬を盗むんだ！
str_rohan_rumor_7|砂漠の馬やヴァリアグの馬を見た事があるんだけど、 ローハン産のほうが明らかに上だね。 でも、 乗りこなすには乗り手の経験がより必要なんだ。
str_rohan_rumor_8|ワーグは馬より遅いが、 より小回りが利くんだ。 それと、 よく飼育された軍馬に比べると、 たいぶぜい弱だね。
str_rohan_rumor_9|ローハンと対戦する軍は、 ローハンの騎兵への対抗策として パイクや槍で武装しているんだ。 裏切り者のサルマンは、 この戦争が終わるまえには ファンゴルンの森を伐採し尽くしてしまうよ。

str_rohan_rumor_11|ゴンドールで目にする馬のほとんどは、 我々が育てた馬なんだよ。 彼らは、 ゴンドールの重装備にも耐えられる、 足が遅くても力の強い馬を好むんだ。
str_rohan_rumor_12|ローハンでは、馬は人間と同じだ、 と言うんだ。 それはつまり、良い馬だ、 と言ったらそれは、良い人間だ、 という事と同じ意味で、悪い馬だ、 と言ったらそれは、悪い人間だ、 という事と同じ意味なんだ。 要するに、 もし馬が腹を空かせたのなら、 それは人間が腹を空かせているのと同じ事で、 馬が悲しむのは 人間が悲しむのと同様なんだ。 よく言われるのは、 馬が幸せなのは、 人間が幸せなのと一緒の事なんだ。 馬が怒っているときは、 人間が怒っているときと同様なんだ、 とも言われる。 馬が歩いてるっていうのは、 人間が歩いてるって言ってるのと同様で、 年をとった馬は、 年をとった人間と同じなんだ。 小さい馬、 というのは小さい人間、 と同じ意味なんだ。
str_rohan_rumor_13|サルマンのオークどもはたちが悪いが、 たいした防具は身に付けていない。 一振りの良い斧があれば充分さ。

; str_gondor_rumor_9|War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.

; str_gondor_rumor_13|Don't tell anyone I said this, but I think Prince Imrahil should perhaps become king. Lord Denethor is a noble man, but Gondor has faded much during his reign. And not only since his older son left.
; str_gondor_rumor_14|People say the Nine rode out of Minas Morgul again. I wish we had more brave captains like Boromir to lead our men into battle against such ancient foes.
; str_gondor_rumor_15|The Southerners are pushing us out of Harondor. They've been raiding us hard for some time. I wish I could walk safely through the green fields of Lebennin again. But we are told 'No.', our soldiers are to protect the heart of the realm.

; str_gondor_rumor_17|There is a strange black rock near Erech. I went to see it once with my father. People say it's laid over a chamber where the last son of the sea kings sleeps. I think it's just a rock.

; str_beorn_rumor_8|The strength of the axe is not in the blade, but in the haft.
; str_beorn_rumor_9|We slept through the last winter. What? Yes, you need to eat a lot in the autumn to last through winter like this.
; str_beorn_rumor_10|Men of Rohan are our kin, bears are our blood, goblins are our prey!
; str_beorn_rumor_11|Turn into bears? Of course we don't. Who told you that? Ha ha ha!
; str_beorn_rumor_12|Beorn was a great man. No, not a man, a giant!
; str_beorn_rumor_13|*GROWLS*   Do you have any honey?
; str_beorn_rumor_14|Don't wander off alone in the mountains! Bears and wolves stay away from larger groups of men. But hunger, or as some say - shadow spirits, may drive them close enough to attack you.
; str_lorien_rumor_begin|O Lórien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. 
; str_lorien_rumor_2|Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! There is in her and in this land, no evil, unless a man bring it hither himself. Then let him beware!
; str_lorien_rumor_3|The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.
; str_lorien_rumor_4|Good and ill have not changed since yesteryear; nor are they one thing among Elves and Dwarves, and another among Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden Wood as in his own house.
; str_lorien_rumor_5|Often does hatred hurt itself!
; str_lorien_rumor_6|Ancient magic protects Lothlórien, so powerful the Darkness does not yet dare challenge it.
; str_lorien_rumor_7|Nathlo i nathal! You are safe within the golden woods. Posto vae - rest now, eat and drink. If you must leave then, carry with you a memory of how Lorien once was.
; str_lorien_rumor_8|It is said that the sea calls to everyone, sooner or later. I too shall hear the gulls one day, leave Laurelindórenan for good. I Harthon an lend and. 
; str_lorien_rumor_9|Av-'osto - do not be afraid! More than our grey cloaks protect us from the enemy here.
; str_imladris_rumor_begin|May the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you.
; str_imladris_rumor_2|May the stars shine upon your faces!
; str_imladris_rumor_3|He that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.
; str_imladris_rumor_4|We must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope, if hope it be.
; str_imladris_rumor_5|Despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.
; str_imladris_rumor_6|Even after the coldest winter flowers do spring. And after the longest night, comes a new dawn.
; str_imladris_rumor_7|So many had gathered when last I rode to war. The light of the drawing of our swords was like a fire in a field of reeds. So few have left Imladris now. 
; str_imladris_rumor_8|Áva rucë! The Eldar have taken arms to fight the enemy alongside brave Edain once more.  Perhaps for the last time, who knows? We sing of war, of fire and the end of the Night.
; str_imladris_rumor_9|I see the men from the East ride under the Dark Lord's banner and it is as though I watched their ancestors again - waves of horsemen shattering upon the gleaming shieldwall of the Last Alliance. If only the memory of Edain was as long as ours.
; str_woodelf_rumor_begin|An Elven-maid there was of old, /A shining star by day: /Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, /Her shoes of silver-grey.
; str_woodelf_rumor_2|Time does not tarry ever, but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to them. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves.
; str_woodelf_rumor_3|Darkness and evil creep over these once beautiful woods. Unless they are stopped, they will smother all hope, all light.
; str_woodelf_rumor_4|Quick and nimble, quiet and precise, we can yet keep the Darkness at bay. But how much longer?
; str_woodelf_rumor_5|Shhh, no dhínen! There may be orcs lurking around. We must be on guard!
; str_woodelf_rumor_6|*stares at you, obviously annoyed by your presence*
; str_woodelf_rumor_7|Oduleg hi am man theled? We need to know your purpose here. Sorcerer's spies are everywhere.
; str_woodelf_rumor_8|Edain of Dale make intricate toys these days! They've learnt much from the Naugrim.
; str_woodelf_rumor_9|The shadow of Dol Guldur is spreading. Dark creatures have been seen in the woods, our outposts attacked, hunters disappear and are never seen again. Our patrols now number at least 35 soldiers, we have grown that fearful!
; str_dale_rumor_begin|First there was the dragon, now this...
; str_dale_rumor_2|As if the orcs coming from the north weren't bad enough, now the hordes from the east are upon us!
; str_dale_rumor_3|Ever since the defeat of the dragon, we know how to look for the enemy's weak spot.
; str_dale_rumor_4|Easterlings will never make it past us and our dwarven allies.
; str_dale_rumor_5|Have you ever seen the sun rise over the Long lake? The colours used to make my heart sing. But now all I see is a red dawn. A bad omen.
; str_dale_rumor_6|Dwarves are a bit too attached to treasures. We still don't know what to think of Thorin Oakenshield.
; str_dale_rumor_7|The men of Rohan are our cousins and our own language is very similar to theirs.
; str_dale_rumor_8|Esgaroth got its name from an Elven word for reeds, because of its reed banks. Did you know that?
; str_dale_rumor_9|The dragon was a sort of a monster noone wants to see ever again.
; str_dale_rumor_10|Our prosperity comes from trade with the Dwarves and the Elves. But it's hard to bargain with Dwarves. Very little profit there.
; str_harad_rumor_begin|The Black Snake will strike swift and deadly.
; str_harad_rumor_2|By the Serpent! Our beasts will trample Gondorians into the dirt.
; str_harad_rumor_3|Odum vermajál otí verthaba av daranaja-e-jatánus!
; str_harad_rumor_4|There is much gold and gems in Gondor. And even more in the lands beyond.
; str_harad_rumor_5|We will catch many western weaklings and sacrifice them to the Serpent God.
; str_harad_rumor_6|Corsairs have their uses, they sail well, but are rowdy and unclean in appearance and sneaky in behaviour.
; str_harad_rumor_7|I'd never set foot on a ship. Corsairs can have all the seas as far as I am concerned.
; str_harad_rumor_8|Warriors of Khand are fierce and fearless, but their strategy is too simple.
; str_harad_rumor_9|I'm counting on good loot in the West. We were promised it. Then I can return home and run my carpet shop in peace.
; str_harad_rumor_10|Keep away from the Mumakil. They are ill-tempered beasts and will squash you in an instant.
; str_harad_rumor_11|In Harad we have deserts and jungles, mountains and sea. Our peoples are as diverse as our lands and as numerous as the grains of sand.
; str_harad_rumor_12|Many knights from Harondor prefer sabres over straight blades. They're quite good for cutting down running peasants, but you need a spear or a good sword to penetrate strong armour.
; str_harad_rumor_13|My blood brother signed up with the Karka - he's a scout now. Riders of 'The Fang' lead a dangerous life, but it is good experience for young hot-headed boys.
; str_harad_rumor_14|Don't ever pick a fight with the Lion brotherhood! Their reputation is well earned.
; str_harad_rumor_15|I wish we had more weapons made of black iron. Many still have to manage with bronze, some even with wooden clubs and javelins of black glass, running into battle naked.
; str_gunda_rumor_begin|Take warm lands from men we come!
; str_gunda_rumor_2|Sharkû promised warm caves.
; str_gunda_rumor_3|Enough hiding in the cold mountains! Now we march into warm lands of men.
; str_gunda_rumor_4|We saw a slimy skulker in our mountain tunnels, but could never catch him. He just disappeared when we got close.
; str_gunda_rumor_5|The Isengarders think they're something special because the old man is equipping them.
; str_gunda_rumor_6|We will burn the villages of men to keep us warm.
; str_gunda_rumor_7|Manlings will feel the frostbite we will bring to them. And afterwards the fire. Ha ha ha!
; str_gunda_rumor_8|Azog and Bolg almost defeated dwarves, elves and manlings last time. But bird-monsters and bear-men saved them. *spit*
; str_gunda_rumor_9|Dwarf-flesh is tough and stringy. Man-flesh is better.
; str_gunda_rumor_10|Bear-men came from the woods and ate Boldush. Bad luck for Boldush! Ha ha ha!
; str_gunda_rumor_11|Some moved to Moria, much room there. But also Ghâsh in the deep. Best stay away!
; str_moria_rumor_begin|When you hear drums - run and hide!
; str_moria_rumor_2|Ghâsh is in the deep!
; str_moria_rumor_3|Doom! Doom! Doom! Drums of the deep.
; str_moria_rumor_4|Moria is big, but no dwarves hide in it anymore.
; str_moria_rumor_5|Dwarves dug too deep. All the better for us. Ha ha ha!
; str_moria_rumor_6|Many tunnels in Moria. We don't go to all.
; str_moria_rumor_7|Some manlings and dwarves sneaked past our sentries in the mines a while ago. We doubled the watch since.
; str_moria_rumor_8|Dwarves will never set foot here again! Ever!
; str_moria_rumor_9|When we gather enough troops, we will go and burn down woods of elves.
; str_moria_rumor_10|Not much food in Moria. We're hungry. Must catch men and elves!
; str_moria_rumor_11|Some go to the forest in the south. None come out.
; str_umbar_rumor_begin|All the seas will belong to the black sails!
; str_umbar_rumor_2|There's no Gondor ships left to sink, now we go plunder inland.
; str_umbar_rumor_3|Umbar is our fate! And it will be Gondor's too.
; str_umbar_rumor_4|Gondorians can't sail! They've got land-legs.
; str_umbar_rumor_5|We've killed Gondorian kings in the past. Now they don't even have a king for us to kill.
; str_umbar_rumor_6|The sneaky Gondorians burned our fleet years ago. Now it's Gondor that'll burn.
; str_umbar_rumor_7|Nothing the sea can throw at us frightens a corsair. But we heard some disturbing rumours about abominations on land.
; str_umbar_rumor_8|We will spill over Gondor like a giant wave and reclaim our long lost lands.
; str_umbar_rumor_9|Haradrim don't drink rum. Did you know that? We like some, to steady the harpoon hand.
; str_umbar_rumor_10|I saw some Variags of Khand fighting. I wouldn't want to be facing them in battle. It is a good thing they are on our side.
; str_khand_rumor_begin|A fight is a fight, no matter how bloody. But retreat is the greatest shame!
; str_khand_rumor_2|Our swords once drawn, must have blood!
; str_khand_rumor_3|The ground trembles under our heavy cataphract cavalry, but our enemies tremble at the mere mention of us!
; str_khand_rumor_4|This time we left the Wainriders behind, our attack will catch the enemies off guard.
; str_khand_rumor_5|We are the Variags of Khand, the fiercest warriors anywhere!
; str_khand_rumor_6|Rhun warriors are fierce too, but they fight on horseback, we rather maul our enemies on foot.
; str_khand_rumor_7|We have fought Gondorians in the past, this time we will finish them for good!
; str_khand_rumor_8|The West is weak and decadent. They have no warrior spirit. They will fall to our swords and axes.
; str_khand_rumor_9|We do not fight for gold or slaves, we fight for honour and glory!
; str_khand_rumor_10|The men of the West are arrogant, they do not know what might they are facing!
; str_khand_rumor_11|We trade with Rhun, Mordor and Harad. And sometimes we fight them too. It is the way of our people.
; str_khand_rumor_12|Have you made your warrior mask yet? You'll need one soon! If the enemy can't see your face, his spirit won't be able to find you.
; str_good_rumor_begin|From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.
; str_good_rumor_2|Orcs fight better at night but are weaker by day.
; str_good_rumor_3|Urukhai are a different breed of orc that doesn't fear sunlight!
; str_good_rumor_4|Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows again.
; str_good_rumor_5|The Dead Marshes... a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing.
; str_good_rumor_6|The Shadow that bred can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don't think it gave life to the orcs, it only ruined them and twisted them.
; str_good_rumor_7|Greenwood it used to be called and full of elves it was. Greatest of the forests of the Northern world. But now it's Mirkwood. Crawling with all manner of evil creatures.
; str_good_rumor_8|The Argonath, The Pillars of the Kings, great guardians of the old northern border of Gondor.
; str_good_rumor_9|Amon Hen is the westernmost of the three peaks at the southern end of Nen Hithoel.
; str_neutral_rumor_begin|Tomorrow everything could change...
; str_neutral_rumor_2|Dead Marshes... a place defiled and diseased.
; str_neutral_rumor_3|The land used to be much different once.
; str_neutral_rumor_4|Stay clear of Fangorn forest.
; str_evil_rumor_begin|Orcs fight better at night, men fight better by day.
; str_evil_rumor_2|Fight horseman with pike, footman with arrow and archer with shield!
; str_evil_rumor_3|Large statues of weaklings on the big river will not stand much longer.
; str_legendary_rumor_begin|Legend says that trees meet to talk in Fangorn.
; str_legendary_rumor_amonhen|They say there is a special place on the Anduin, somewhere where the big statues stand.
; str_legendary_rumor_deadmarshes|It is rumoured all dead seems alive in the middle of Dead Marshes.
; str_legendary_rumor_mirkwood|Creatures other than orcs crawl around Mirkwood.
; str_legendary_rumor_fangorn|Fangorn is a forest best avoided. Unusual things happen there.
; str_last_rumor|I haven't heard anything interesting lately.
; str_ent_rumor_begin|Do not be hasty now...
; str_ent_rumor_2|Learn now the lore of Living Creatures! First name the four, the free peoples: Eldest of all, the elf-children; Dwarf the delver, dark are his houses; Ent the earthborn, old as mountains; Man the mortal, master of horses.
; str_ent_rumor_3|The Old Entish is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to.
